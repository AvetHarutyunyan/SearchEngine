# C++ Search Engine
## 📜 Project Overview

This project implements a simplified **Search Server** core written in C++. The application is designed to simulate the core functionality of a search engine, focusing on efficient data indexing and query processing.

The key features include:
1.  **Indexing**: Creating an **Inverted Index** that maps words to the documents they appear in, enabling fast lookups.
2.  **Configuration**: Reading configuration settings, document paths, and query requests from JSON files (`config.json`, `requests.json`).
4.  **Output**: Writing the ranked search results to an output JSON file (`answers.json`).
